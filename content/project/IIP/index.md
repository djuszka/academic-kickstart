## Objective of Future Internet Engineering

The project covers the development and testing of infrastructure and services for the future generation Internet, i.e. IPv6 Internet and Future Internet. It is expected that new generations of Internet (one of the research priorities in the scope of European Union Framework Programmes) will contribute substantially to civilizational development in Europe by using their capabilities in all or almost all areas of human activity.

The aim of this project, in the scope of IPv6 Internet, is to develop a methodology for the evolutionary replacement of current version of IP (IPv4) in the national network by the IPv6 protocol and to propose new network solutions and services resulting from IPv6. The aim of this project, in the scope of Future Internet, is to develop and to test a proposal of a new architecture based on the resources virtualization along with new mechanisms and algorithms concerning the crucial aspects of network operations. The goal of the project is to create a national test network environment for the IPv6 Internet and Future Internet, enabling research and development activities based on the experimental verification. 

The project is financed by the European Union through the European Regional Development Fund under the Operational Programme 'Innovative Economy' for the years 2007-2013.

**Project number:** POIG.01.01.02-00-045/09-00
