## Objective of SARACEN

The rapid progress in hardware/software media technologies has changed the role of individuals from passive content consumers to active content creator/producers. It is clear that in a few years everyone will be multimedia content producer (by publishing digital pictures, video recordings, remote e-health services, home surveillance, etc.), multimedia content mediator (by storing/forwarding streaming content) and multimedia content consumer (digital television, video on demand, mobile broadcasting and alike). Within such environment, collaborative, social /context aware and scalable media distribution is required for: 

a) maintaining the integrity and quality of delivered multimedia content, 

b) optimizing the quality of experience in a way of delivering truly personalized high Quality of Experience (QoE) media streaming services, 

c) adapting and enriching the quality of media across the whole distribution chain.
