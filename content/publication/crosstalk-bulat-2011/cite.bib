 abstract = {Cross talk is one of the most important parameters of the 3D displays' quality. Different cross talk definitions exist, which makes cross talk measurement and comparison difficult. We take a step back and focus on a detailed 3D display luminance analysis. The conclusions we draw from the temporal luminance analysis can be used to propose an effective approach to cross talk measurements. In scope of the presented work we have measured four different 3D displays.},
