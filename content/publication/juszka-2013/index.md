abstract: "Now growing interest in 3D video services inevitably brings a greater need to measure their quality. From a financial point of view alone, it is crucial for providers to offer users the best experience possible. Such measurements are necessary in order to optimize the performance of telecommunication networks or to plan new investment. Unfortunately, the nature of this kind of service makes it almost impossible to use existing and verified 2D quality metrics. Therefore, suitable 3D quality metrics are urgently needed. In this paper, we propose one such solution - an objective, bitstream quality metric for stereoscopic high definition video affected by compression and packet loss in a network. © 2013 IEEE."
