abstract: "Both the wide access to Video-on-Demand services and the large availability of tag information enable today's users to make conscious decisions on the video content they watch. This signifies a dramatic change in user behaviour compared to previous generations, whose choice was constrained by TV listings, which further restricted the time of viewing. Most subjective video quality studies use short-duration sequences that are specifically designed to use encoding algorithms and do not consider the subjective characteristics of the content as variables. For these reasons, the user's motivations to watch video content should be included in Quality of Experience measurement methods. This paper shows that subjective assessment of personal interest in video content, its visual attractiveness and quality of 3D effects do not correlate with objective parameters usually used for test sequence selection: spatial perceptual information, temporal perceptual information and mean scene-cut density."
