 abstract = {Recent advances in video distribution over the Internet have inevitably led to the need for accompanying the video related value-added services with the means for maintaining integrity and quality of distributed media to optimize Quality of Experience (QoE). Current systems cover the aspects of maintaining the quality of 2D (only) media by conducting user requirements surveys and 2D QoE assessments. This paper presents the work performed in the EU FP7 SARACEN research project on personalized 3D media streaming over P2P architectures, together with evaluation tests and results as regards scalable and adaptive coding for 3D video streams.
