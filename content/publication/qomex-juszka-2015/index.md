abstract: "Randomization is the best method to avoid any effects on the grading of tiredness or adaptation in a subjective experiment. Researchers' attention usually concentrates on a random order of stimuli in a clip displayed to a subject, but sometimes, due to the large number of stimuli to assess, it is necessary to divide the test material into a few clips and conduct a series of assessment sessions for each subject. Herein we present a study providing on evidence that there are significant differences in subjective assessment depending on the order in which clips are displayed, especially when the experiment concerns assessing the subjective experience of emerging technologies."
