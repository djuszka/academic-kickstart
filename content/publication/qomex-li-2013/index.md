abstract: "Quality of Experience (QoE) in 3DTV may be influenced by many factors, such as the viewing conditions, the characteristics of the panel of viewers, etc. In this study, the impact of two factors, namely the test environment and the display technology are analyzed. Particularly, two paired comparison experiments have been carried out to assess the overall preference of experience (PoE) for a set of 3D video sequences. The first experiment, performed at University of Nantes, allows comparing the results obtained in a standard laboratory versus living-room-like environment. No significance difference has been found. The second experiment, performed at Brno University, allows comparing the results obtained using stereoscopic display with shutter glasses versus polarized glasses. Significance difference could be identified depending on the video content. Since the same test material has been used in both locations, inter-laboratory correlation is also analyzed."
