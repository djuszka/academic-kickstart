## Abstract of Ph.D. dissertation

One of the fundamental problems in subjective Quality of Experience (QoE) assessment experiments design is source material selection which subsequently forms a basis for stimuli generation. Obviously, subjective experiments rely on human subjects, who cannot be treated only as quality degradation level detectors. A specificity of such experiments requires putting under investigation the source material which is as similar as possible to the video provided in real-life services. Some suggestions on source material selection issues can be found in related recommendations, and these seems not to have been proved scientifically – so broader research needs to be conducted. However, unfortunately, video sequences used in subjective experiments are substantially different from content widely available to users in Video-on-Demand repositories.

The dissertation deals with the problem of video content impact on subjective quality assessment scores. Video content features are operationalised by three cognitive attributes: level of interestingness, level of visual attractiveness and 3D effect experience (depth experience). Gradation of video quality is introduced by streaming on four bitrate levels.

The first stage of research is devoted to the design of an authorial database – a collection of video shots from commercially available feature films and documentaries. Sequences are selected considering not only objective metrics – temporal activity (that generally indicates the amount of temporal changes of a video sequence) and spatial activity (that generally indicates the amount of spatial detail of a picture), but also results of a subjective experiment.

In the main stage of the research, the authorial database is compared with a commonly used database, designed for research purposes. In order to include a subjective assessment of cognitive attributes, keeping in mind state-of-the-art on factors influencing subjective quality assessment, an innovative experimental scenario is proposed. Additionally, this scenario enables a proper comparisons between both databases considering cognitive attributes of video content.

Statistical analysis of the collected results using a stochastic dominance analysis adjusted to a 5-point Likert scale makes it possible to prove the thesis:
***It is possible to assess the impact of cognitive attributes of video content on perceptual quality of video affected by artifacts related to bitrate reduction, using a relevant experimental scenario.***

The obtained results show that quality assessment scores depend on intensity of content cognitive attributes. Moreover, it is proved that test material commonly used in research is assessed higher for lower bitrates.

## Acknowledgements

This work would be impossible without the support from many remarkable people who were around me during previous years. Our life-paths have crossed, but they are innocent as a lamb.

First, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my supervisor Professor Zdzisław Papir. His synthetic approach to delivering ideas with respect to analytical thinking helped me throughout the entire research period and whilst writing of this thesis.

I would like to thank Bogdan Ćmiel Ph.D., my auxiliary supervisor, who shared his expertise in statistics and methods for data analysis. Such support made my decisions ironclad. Collaboration with Bogdan would not be possible without Adam Ćmiel Ph.D. to whom I am also indebted for the fruitful consultancy. My sincere thanks also go to Professor Michał Wierzchoń (Jagiellonian University) whose advice on psychological issues of my experiments was helpful. His expertise and outstanding ability to instantly distil an accurate psychological problem from a technical description is inspiring for me.

Having an acceptance from heads of Department of Telecommunications is not mandatory for starting Ph.D. studies, but it undeniably makes difference in Quality of Experience. That is why I would like to thank Professor Andrzej Pach, who, as a leader created a great environment for work and collaboration. Given this opportunity I feel very honoured. I would like to thank Professor Marek Natkaniec, who took over the reins in the Department and also ensured I still felt welcomed there. 

My thanks are also due to my colleagues from Department of Telecommunications with whom I cooperated in scientific projects: Michał Grega Ph.D., Mikołaj Leszczuk Ph.D., Lucjan Janowski Ph.D., Jarosław Bułat Ph.D., Piotr Romaniak Ph.D. -- they introduced me into scientific team work and gave me an opportunity to listen and share ideas during project meetings.

My time in room 309 at Department of Telecommunication was fruitful and spent in the wonderful presence of friends. I experienced a lot of support and motivation from an amazing marriage: Professor Katarzyna Kosek-Szott and Professor Szymon Szott. The role of Michał Grega Ph.D. is also remarkable -- his attitude, kindness, the way he works, manages projects and prepares grant applications helped me in my own attempts and in dealing with successes.

Great influence on my attitude towards scientific work had philosophical seminars and discussions organized by Professors: Jerzy Stelmach, Bartosz Brożek and Wojciech Załuski from [Copernicus Center for Interdisciplinary Studies in Krakow](https://www.copernicuscenter.edu.pl/) and [Jagiellonian University]( https://www.law.uj.edu.pl/~kfpep/ ). I would like to thank also my friends from these seminars: [Mateusz Hohol](https://hohol.pl/), Bartłomiej Kucharzyk, Łukasz Kwiatek, Bartosz Janik, Mateusz Tondera, Katarzyna Eliasz, Julia Stanek, Karolina Prochownik, Aleksandra Głos and Khrystyna Pothapenko.

Many thanks are also due to my friends: Michał Hajduk M.Sc., Konrad Gałczyński M.Sc., Michał Trzeciak M.Sc. and Michał Szachnitowski M.Sc. for their support and patience.

My warm thoughts go to my parents -- Kazimiera and Henryk and their enormous effort, which brought me to this point. I would like to thank my older brother Karol for (unconsciously) bushwhacking many life-paths for me.
